How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You can easily see the changes made to the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see previous versions and what changes were made and when.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros:
- you select when to commit
- tracking multiple files
cons:
- not automatic

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they don't know which changes belong together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log list the history of files, git diff prints the difference between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You can always find what causes the problems.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For all of my coding projects.
