When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When other people work on the project too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To decide which changes I want to pull and when.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: are clones made on GitHub from other's repositories to your new made repository (on GitHub).
Clones: are clones of some repository (local or remote) to new location mostly locally.
Branches: are branches emerging from master branch which are in the same repository.

Forks and clones are used to copy other repository so you can make changes indenpendently from original source not interferring into that source.
Branches are used to make changes beside master branch for experimental purposes, removing bugs, adding new features and similar processes and than 
incorporate them into master branch or if not wanted remove that branches with no impact on master branch.
